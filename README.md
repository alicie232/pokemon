## Exercise

Together as a group choose one of the following APIs to work with:

1. [Pokemon API](https://pokeapi.co)
2. [Studio Ghibli API](https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/)
3. [Rick & Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/)

The goal of this exercise is to work in a **group** and build a simple app which uses data from an API.

As a group please consider [mob-programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mob_programming). Some rules to follow:

- Change the driver (person who codes) every 20-30 minutes
- Each team member should code at some point
- Be respectful, kind and considerate to other team members
